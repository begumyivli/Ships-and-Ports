# Ships-and-Ports
In this project, Iimplement a simulation of a port management system. 
The main objectiveis to analyze the requests provided in input
and carry out the necessary actions.
There are ports, and ships are sailing between them. Ships are
carrying the following types of containers: basic, heavy,
refrigerated, liquid, and each of them should be handled differently.
Containers in a port can be loaded to ships, and, conversely, they can
be unloaded from a ship to port. Ships need a certain amount of fuel
to sail from one port to another.
There is no user interaction during the execution, the
program parses the input file composed of the sequential operations.
